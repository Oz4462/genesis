"""Conformal-bounded retrieval of reasoning steps.

Given a new query, we ask the TraceStore for its k-nearest reasoning steps
(measured by d = 1 - cosine on a normalized embedding space) and then filter
the result against a conformal threshold tau supplied by a calibrator.

If at least one candidate's score is <= tau, that candidate is considered
within the calibrated reuse band and is safe to splice into the new prompt
under the bound's (alpha) miscoverage guarantee. Otherwise we abstain: the
query gets handled by the underlying reasoning model the normal way, and the
fresh trace becomes a new calibration point.

This module returns plain data; it never calls an LLM. The compose layer
takes its output and assembles a prompt; the receipt layer records the bound
and the retrieved step ids for audit.
